    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "The algorithm I designed takes the advantage of bigram, bidirectional bigram and unigram algorithms. It tries to use as much information as possible to make the most evidently reasonable prediction. If the characters before and after the “_\" are known (\"[c1] _ [c3]\"), the algorithm will try to predict the guess using P(c_x|c_x-1 c_x+1), the bidirectional bigram; If only the character before the \"_\" is known (\"[c1] _ _\"), the algorithm will back off and predict by P(c_x|c_x-1) only, the bigram algorithm; If the character before \"_\" is not known (\"_ _\"), the algorithm will back off to P(c_x), the unigram algorithm. All those three algorithms bring the incorrect guesses to as low as 7.739 (less than 8). Throughout this assignment, the random guess algoritm has the worst performance at approx. 16 incorrect rate, and unigram is much better at 11 incorrect. While bigram with unigram back off brings the incorrect rate to even lower at 10. After adding up bidirectional bigram, the incorrect rate goes to the lowest ever at 7.7. Generally speaking, the more relevant information is ultilised correctly, the better performance of the algorithm will be.\n",
